Final project for Tangible Electronics for Teaching and Learning course.

This repository consists of 2 main codes:
1. Arduino code in C# (4 files, one for each level)
2. Processing code in Java (1 file)

I separated the Arduino code into 4 files because my laptop memory cannot contain the whole code. Make sure you adjust the port for the Processing code.
